    /// - Important: *DO NOT* attempt to call the parent coordinator's `handle(action: _)` method when handling actions
    ///              as this may cause a race condition. Always call the parent coordinator's `handle(action: _)`

    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - action: Action to be propagated.
    /// - Precondition: A `.broadcast` action cannot be propagated using this function. Attempting to do so could
    /// result in a recursive loop. Calling this action with a `.broadcast` action will do nothing in production.
    /// Use `handle(action: _)` to handle this action instead.
